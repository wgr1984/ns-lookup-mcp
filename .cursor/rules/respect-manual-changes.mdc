      When encountering manual changes in the code:

      1. Preservation Guidelines:
         - Do not automatically revert manual changes
         - Try to understand the intent behind the changes
         - If changes seem unusual, ask for clarification
         - Preserve manual optimizations and fixes

      2. Before modifying manually changed code:
         - Review the changes carefully
         - Understand the context and purpose
         - Consider the implications of modifications
         - Ask for clarification if intent is unclear

      3. When in doubt:
         - Ask about the purpose of manual changes
         - Request explanation of unusual patterns
         - Seek confirmation before modifying
         - Document the reasoning in comments

      4. Best practices:
         - Keep track of manual modifications
         - Document reasons for manual changes
         - Consider the broader impact
         - Maintain a dialogue about significant changes

examples:
  - input: |
      // Manual optimization to prevent unnecessary redraws
      if (!shouldUpdate && prevState === currentState) {
        return;
      }
    output: "Before modifying this optimization, understand why it was added manually"
